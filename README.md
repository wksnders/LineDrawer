# LineDrawer
created in C# to draw lines in a randomized pattern
currently a WORK IN PROGRESS this porgram is working to be a possible tool for inspiring artists
it's meant to gereate random lines and points in a controllable manner so that anyone lacking insparation can find an endless sequence
of ranomized lines/points that could spark their creativity.

Initial design desisions 
Start working on vectors and representing points (points will later be used as midpoints for generating lines)
starting with a black background (possibly adding a setting to change this later)
